## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Program doesn't start**:
- Ensure you're in the `build\bin\Release` folder
- Check that `assets` and `shaders` folders are present in the same directory
- Verify OpenGL 3.3+ support: run `glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"` (Linux) or check graphics driver

**Textures not loading**:
- Run `python generate_textures.py` to create textures
- Check that `assets/` folder contains .jpg files
- Program will use default colors if textures fail (still functional)

**Shaders not compiling**:
- Verify `shaders/` folder is copied to executable directory
- Check console output for specific shader errors
- Ensure graphics drivers support GLSL 3.30

**Can't see buildings in 3D**:
- Buildings may be behind your starting position
- Use WASD to move around
- Hold Right Mouse and drag to look around
- Try different initial positions

**Can't select building in 2D**:
- Ensure you're in 2D mode (not 3D)
- Click inside the building rectangle outline
- Look for yellow highlight to confirm selection

**Building won't move**:
- Check if building is selected (yellow highlight)
- You may be at city boundary (console shows "outside bounds")
- Try moving in a different direction

**GLFW/GLAD not found during build**:
- Windows: Verify vcpkg installation and CMake toolchain path
- Linux: Install dev packages (`libglfw3-dev`)
- macOS: Use Homebrew to install dependencies

**Performance issues**:
- Reduce number of buildings at startup
- Disable fast-forward time (press Y for normal speed)
- Update graphics drivers
